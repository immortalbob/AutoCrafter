This Meta will automatically craft many items. Full list below.

Simply place AutoCrafter.met in your vtank folder (C:\games\virindi plugins\vtank)

Once loaded, a "View" will be created with a "Go" button, this starts the auto-craft process. Specialty items will also have their own button in the "View".

Starting the auto-craft process will attempt to make every item possible from the list below, if the components are in your inventory. Be aware.

EXAMPLE: If you want to make a Wrapped Bundle of Deadly Acid Arrowheads, you will need at least 1 Wrapped Bundle of Arrowheads, 1 Brimstone Pea, 1 Quicksilver Pea, 1 Stibnite Pea, 3 Concentrated Aqua Incanta and an Alembic in your inventory.

If it does not craft something it is likely that you don't have the skill that is required trained, OR you are missing a tool/component. It does not check whether your skill is high enough to succeed, just that the skill is trained.

For this to work, you need VTank obviously, Mag-Tools is only required for items with the same name that are combined together, such as Pyreal Motes.

You probably also want to either load in some stam rations to the items tab, or have life magic to restam until the devs remove the stupid stamina burn on crafting...

one last thing, you must turn off the crafting chance of success dialog for this to function if you use it:
/config UseCraftSuccessDialog off
/config UseCraftSuccessDialog on
